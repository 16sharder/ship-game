# The Ship Game

Project Author: Sara Harder

This was the portfolio project for a in introductory computer science class at Oregon State University.

This game simulates battleship, and is functional within an IDE (originally created with PyCharm).\
Because it is only intended for use within an IDE, it does not contain any images, which can make play a little bit hard to follow.\
Run the file game_play to start the game.

Completed February 2022
